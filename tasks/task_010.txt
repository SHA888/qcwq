# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop comprehensive documentation and project roadmap
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Create detailed documentation, learning paths, and future development roadmap for the project.
# Details:
Create docs/README.md with project overview, goals, and quick start guide. Develop docs/LEARNING_PATHS.md with suggested learning sequences for different user profiles (beginners, developers, researchers). Create docs/ROADMAP.md outlining future development plans and opportunities for contribution. Develop a comprehensive index of all notebooks and scripts with descriptions in docs/CONTENT_INDEX.md. Create FAQ document addressing common questions and issues. Include a glossary of quantum computing terms in docs/GLOSSARY.md. Add documentation on how to cite the project for academic use. Create visual diagrams showing the relationships between different components of the project.

# Test Strategy:
Review all documentation for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Test navigation between documents to ensure a coherent user experience. Verify that all content is properly indexed and findable. Have users with different backgrounds review the learning paths for appropriateness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create project overview and quick start documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the main README.md file with project overview, goals, and quick start guide
### Details:
Create docs/README.md containing: 1) Project title and tagline, 2) Overview of what the project does, 3) Key features and capabilities, 4) Project goals and vision, 5) Installation instructions, 6) Quick start guide with basic examples, 7) License information, and 8) Contact information for maintainers. Format using clear Markdown with appropriate headings, code blocks for commands, and screenshots if relevant.

## 2. Develop learning paths documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create structured learning paths for different user profiles
### Details:
Create docs/LEARNING_PATHS.md with: 1) Introduction explaining the purpose of learning paths, 2) Beginner path with fundamentals of quantum computing and basic usage of the project, 3) Developer path focusing on extending the project and contributing code, 4) Researcher path emphasizing advanced quantum algorithms and applications, 5) Each path should include recommended sequence of notebooks/resources, estimated time commitments, and prerequisites. Include cross-references to relevant notebooks and external resources.

## 3. Create project roadmap document [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Outline future development plans and contribution opportunities
### Details:
Create docs/ROADMAP.md containing: 1) Current project status and version information, 2) Short-term goals (next 3-6 months), 3) Medium-term goals (6-12 months), 4) Long-term vision, 5) Specific planned features and enhancements, 6) Areas open for community contribution, 7) Known limitations to be addressed. Format the roadmap with clear timelines, priorities, and status indicators for each planned item.

## 4. Develop content index and glossary [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive index of all project content and a glossary of quantum terms
### Details:
Create two documents: 1) docs/CONTENT_INDEX.md with a table listing all notebooks and scripts, including title, brief description, complexity level, and prerequisites, organized by category; 2) docs/GLOSSARY.md with alphabetically sorted definitions of quantum computing terms used throughout the project, including cross-references to relevant notebooks where concepts are explained in detail.

## 5. Create FAQ and citation guidelines [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Develop FAQ document and instructions for academic citation
### Details:
Create two documents: 1) docs/FAQ.md addressing common questions about installation, usage, troubleshooting, and conceptual clarifications, organized by topic; 2) docs/CITATION.md with instructions for citing the project in academic work, including BibTeX entries, DOI information if available, and guidelines for citing specific components of the project. Ensure FAQs address questions that might arise from all user profiles identified in the learning paths.

## 6. Develop visual documentation components [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Create visual diagrams showing relationships between project components
### Details:
Create docs/ARCHITECTURE.md containing: 1) High-level architecture diagram showing major components and their interactions, 2) Workflow diagrams for key processes, 3) Dependency graphs showing relationships between different modules, 4) Visual learning path flowcharts that complement the text-based learning paths. Use tools like Mermaid, PlantUML, or draw.io to create diagrams, and include both the source files and rendered images in the documentation.
