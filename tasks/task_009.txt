# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create contribution guidelines and collaboration framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop comprehensive documentation for contribution workflow, code standards, and community engagement.
# Details:
Create docs/CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed guidelines for: code style and formatting standards, notebook structure and documentation requirements, pull request and code review process, issue reporting templates. Develop docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md outlining community behavior expectations. Create example templates for new notebooks, scripts, and documentation in docs/templates/. Set up GitHub issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, and content suggestions. Write a guide for setting up development environment with pre-commit hooks for code quality. Include examples of good pull requests and contributions to serve as references.

# Test Strategy:
Review all documentation for clarity and completeness. Test the contribution workflow by simulating a new contribution following the guidelines. Verify that templates are functional and easy to use. Ensure all links and references in documentation are valid.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create core contribution documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the main CONTRIBUTING.md file with comprehensive guidelines for code style, formatting standards, and contribution workflow
### Details:
Create docs/CONTRIBUTING.md covering: code style conventions (indentation, naming, comments), formatting standards, notebook structure requirements, documentation guidelines, and the overall contribution workflow. Include sections on how to set up the development environment with pre-commit hooks for code quality. Reference industry standard practices where applicable and provide clear examples for each guideline.

## 2. Develop code of conduct document [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md outlining community behavior expectations and enforcement procedures
### Details:
Create docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md that defines acceptable community behavior, communication standards, and enforcement procedures. Base this on established templates like the Contributor Covenant, but customize it for this project's specific community needs. Include sections on: scope of application, expected behaviors, unacceptable behaviors, enforcement responsibilities, reporting guidelines, and consequences for violations.

## 3. Create template files for contributions [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop standardized templates for notebooks, scripts, and documentation
### Details:
Create a docs/templates/ directory with example templates for: new notebooks (.ipynb with standard sections and documentation), Python scripts (.py with header, imports, and function structure), and documentation files (.md with proper formatting). Each template should follow the standards defined in CONTRIBUTING.md and include placeholder comments explaining each section's purpose. Add a README.md in the templates directory explaining how to use each template.

## 4. Set up GitHub issue templates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create standardized templates for bug reports, feature requests, and content suggestions
### Details:
Set up GitHub issue templates in the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ directory. Create separate YAML-formatted templates for: bug reports (with sections for reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, environment details), feature requests (with sections for problem statement, proposed solution, alternatives considered), and content suggestions (with sections for content type, rationale, outline). Each template should include appropriate labels and provide clear guidance to submitters.

## 5. Document pull request process and examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the PR workflow with examples of good contributions
### Details:
Enhance the CONTRIBUTING.md with a detailed section on the pull request process including: linking PRs to issues, required PR template usage, code review expectations and timelines, and merge criteria. Create a docs/examples/ directory with 2-3 annotated examples of high-quality pull requests that demonstrate proper documentation, code quality, testing, and addressing reviewer feedback. Include a pull request template in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md that prompts contributors to provide context, testing details, and checklist of requirements.
