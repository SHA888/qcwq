# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop advanced quantum algorithms tutorials
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create tutorials for advanced quantum algorithms including VQE, QAOA, and quantum machine learning approaches.
# Details:
Create notebooks/05_advanced_algorithms/ directory with notebooks covering: 1) Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), 2) Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), 3) Quantum Machine Learning basics. For each algorithm, provide: theoretical foundation and use cases, implementation details with parameterized circuits, optimization procedures and classical processing components, visualization of convergence and results. Create reusable components in scripts/advanced_algorithms/ for custom ansatzes, optimizers, and problem encodings. Include examples of applying these algorithms to simple real-world problems (e.g., MaxCut for QAOA, H2 molecule for VQE). Add exercises for extending the algorithms to more complex problems.

# Test Strategy:
Test VQE implementation on simple molecules and compare results with known values. Verify QAOA implementation on small graph problems with known solutions. Test convergence behavior with different optimizers and parameters. Ensure all visualizations correctly represent the algorithm progress and results.
