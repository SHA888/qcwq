# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement fundamental quantum algorithms
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create detailed implementations of foundational quantum algorithms with step-by-step explanations and visualizations.
# Details:
Create notebooks/04_algorithms/ directory with notebooks implementing: 1) Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, 2) Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, 3) Grover's search algorithm, 4) Quantum Fourier Transform. For each algorithm, include: theoretical background and mathematical explanation, step-by-step circuit construction, visualization of intermediate states, comparison of results between simulator and real hardware (where feasible). Create modular implementations in scripts/algorithms/ that can be imported and reused. Include exercises that challenge users to modify the algorithms for different problem instances. Add visualization of algorithm performance scaling compared to classical counterparts.

# Test Strategy:
Verify algorithm implementations by testing with known inputs and comparing outputs to theoretical expectations. Test edge cases for each algorithm. Ensure visualizations correctly represent the quantum states at each step. Verify that the modular implementations can be correctly imported and used in other notebooks.
