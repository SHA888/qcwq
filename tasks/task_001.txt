# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project structure and environment configuration
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the initial project structure with directories for notebooks, scripts, docs, and tests. Develop environment setup guides and validation scripts.
# Details:
Create the following directory structure: `/notebooks` (for Jupyter notebooks), `/scripts` (for Python scripts), `/docs` (for documentation), `/tests` (for test scripts). Create a requirements.txt file listing all dependencies (Qiskit, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.). Write a detailed installation guide in docs/setup.md covering Python, pip, virtual environments, and Qiskit installation for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Develop a validation script (scripts/validate_env.py) that checks if all required packages are installed and prints their versions. Include a simple 'Hello Quantum World' notebook and script that creates and measures a basic circuit.

# Test Strategy:
Run the validation script to ensure it correctly identifies installed/missing packages. Test the installation guide on a clean environment to verify it works as expected. Ensure the example notebook runs without errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create basic directory structure and initialize repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational project structure with all required directories and initialize version control
### Details:
Create the root project directory and the following subdirectories: `/notebooks`, `/scripts`, `/docs`, and `/tests`. Initialize git repository with appropriate .gitignore file for Python projects. Add README.md with project title, brief description, and directory structure explanation. Ensure proper file permissions and create empty __init__.py files in directories that should be importable packages.

## 2. Define dependencies and create requirements.txt [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Document all project dependencies with specific version requirements
### Details:
Create requirements.txt in the root directory listing all required packages with version specifications: Qiskit (>=0.36.0), NumPy (>=1.20.0), Matplotlib (>=3.4.0), Jupyter (>=1.0.0), pytest (>=6.2.5). Include comments explaining the purpose of each dependency. Group dependencies by functionality (quantum computing, data analysis, visualization, development tools). Add instructions for installing with pip at the top of the file.

## 3. Write cross-platform installation guide [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for environment setup across different operating systems
### Details:
Create docs/setup.md with detailed installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Include sections on: 1) Installing Python 3.8+ with download links, 2) Setting up virtual environments (venv/conda), 3) Installing dependencies via requirements.txt, 4) Verifying Qiskit installation, 5) Troubleshooting common issues. Add screenshots or terminal commands for each platform. Include information about recommended IDEs and extensions for quantum computing development.

## 4. Develop environment validation script [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create a script to verify that all dependencies are correctly installed
### Details:
Create scripts/validate_env.py that: 1) Checks Python version (>=3.8), 2) Attempts to import all required packages and catches ImportErrors, 3) Prints installed versions of all dependencies, 4) Verifies Qiskit can connect to IBMQ (optional test), 5) Runs a simple quantum circuit to ensure full functionality, 6) Outputs a summary report of the environment status. Include colorized terminal output for pass/fail status and add command-line arguments for different validation levels (basic/complete).

## 5. Create 'Hello Quantum World' examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Develop introductory examples demonstrating basic quantum circuit creation and measurement
### Details:
Create notebooks/hello_quantum_world.ipynb and scripts/hello_quantum_world.py with identical functionality: 1) Import necessary Qiskit modules, 2) Create a simple quantum circuit with 2 qubits (including Hadamard gate and CNOT gate to create entanglement), 3) Add measurement operations, 4) Execute the circuit on a simulator, 5) Display results with visualization (histogram), 6) Include detailed comments explaining each step of the quantum operations. Add markdown cells in the notebook with theoretical explanation and references to Qiskit documentation.
