# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Qiskit basics notebooks and scripts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create introductory notebooks and scripts covering Qiskit fundamentals, single-qubit operations, and basic visualizations.
# Details:
Create notebooks/01_qiskit_basics/ directory with the following notebooks: 1) Introduction to Qiskit and quantum computing concepts, 2) Single-qubit states and operations, 3) Quantum measurement and visualization. Each notebook should include theoretical explanations, code examples, and interactive exercises. Implement visualization examples using Qiskit's built-in visualization tools for circuits, state vectors, and Bloch spheres. Create corresponding Python scripts in scripts/basics/ that contain the core functionality from the notebooks. Include exercises at the end of each notebook that prompt users to modify circuits and observe results.

# Test Strategy:
Execute all notebooks from start to finish to ensure they run without errors. Verify that all visualizations render correctly. Test the interactive exercises to confirm they work as expected and provide meaningful feedback.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create directory structure and outline content for notebooks and scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the required directory structure and create detailed outlines for all three notebooks and corresponding scripts
### Details:
Create the notebooks/01_qiskit_basics/ and scripts/basics/ directories. Develop detailed outlines for each of the three notebooks (Introduction to Qiskit, Single-qubit states and operations, Quantum measurement and visualization) and their corresponding scripts. Each outline should include section headings, key concepts to cover, planned code examples, and exercise ideas. This foundation will ensure consistent structure and comprehensive coverage across all materials.

## 2. Implement 'Introduction to Qiskit and quantum computing concepts' notebook [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the first notebook covering Qiskit installation, basic quantum computing concepts, and simple circuit creation
### Details:
Develop the first notebook with sections on: Qiskit installation and setup, basic quantum computing concepts (qubits, superposition, entanglement), Qiskit's component structure (Terra, Aer, etc.), creating and running a simple quantum circuit, and executing on simulators. Include code examples for each concept, explanatory text, and 2-3 interactive exercises that prompt users to modify basic circuits. Ensure proper markdown formatting with clear headings, explanations, and code comments.

## 3. Implement 'Single-qubit states and operations' notebook [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create the second notebook covering single-qubit states, gates, and transformations
### Details:
Develop the second notebook with sections on: representing single-qubit states, common single-qubit gates (X, Y, Z, H, S, T), gate matrices and their effects, creating circuits with single-qubit operations, and composing operations. Include visualizations of how gates transform states on the Bloch sphere. Create 3-4 interactive exercises that challenge users to implement specific state transformations using different gate combinations. Ensure proper integration with the first notebook by referencing relevant concepts.

## 4. Implement 'Quantum measurement and visualization' notebook [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Create the third notebook focusing on measurement concepts and visualization techniques
### Details:
Develop the third notebook with sections on: quantum measurement theory, implementing measurements in Qiskit, visualizing circuits using Qiskit's circuit drawer, visualizing statevectors, visualizing states on the Bloch sphere, and histogram visualization for measurement outcomes. Demonstrate how measurement affects quantum states and how to interpret results. Include 3-4 exercises that prompt users to create circuits, predict measurement outcomes, and use different visualization tools. Ensure all visualization examples use Qiskit's built-in visualization tools.

## 5. Create corresponding Python scripts for all notebooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Extract core functionality from notebooks into standalone Python scripts
### Details:
Create Python scripts in the scripts/basics/ directory that contain the core functionality from each notebook. Each script should be well-documented with docstrings and comments. For the first notebook, create scripts for basic circuit creation and execution. For the second notebook, create scripts for implementing single-qubit operations and transformations. For the third notebook, create scripts for measurement and different visualization techniques. Ensure scripts are modular, reusable, and include error handling. Each script should be importable and usable independently.

## 6. Review, test, and finalize all materials [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of all notebooks and scripts, ensuring they work as expected
### Details:
Test all notebooks and scripts to ensure they execute without errors. Verify that all visualizations render correctly. Check that exercises have clear instructions and work as intended. Review explanations for clarity and accuracy. Test notebooks in a clean environment to ensure all dependencies are properly documented. Add a README.md file in each directory explaining the contents and how to use the materials. Make final adjustments based on testing results and ensure consistent formatting and style across all materials.
