# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement quantum gates and circuits tutorials
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive tutorials on quantum gates, multi-qubit operations, and entanglement with interactive examples.
# Details:
Create notebooks/02_gates_and_circuits/ directory with notebooks covering: 1) Standard single-qubit gates (X, Y, Z, H, S, T), 2) Multi-qubit gates and operations (CNOT, CZ, SWAP), 3) Creating entangled states (Bell, GHZ), 4) Circuit composition and advanced operations. Include circuit diagrams, matrix representations, and Bloch sphere visualizations for each gate. Develop interactive exercises where users build circuits to create specific quantum states. Create utility functions in scripts/utils/circuit_helpers.py for common circuit operations. Include challenges that test understanding, such as creating specific entangled states or implementing basic quantum protocols.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all gates and operations work correctly by comparing simulation results with theoretical expectations. Test the entanglement examples by calculating and visualizing correlation measurements. Ensure all interactive components function properly.
