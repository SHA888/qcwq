# 🌀 Quantum Computing with Qiskit (QCWQ) ⚛️

**A beginner-friendly, hands-on repository to explore Quantum Computing using Qiskit.**

---

## 🚀 Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `/notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for tutorials, experiments, and hands-on learning.
- `/scripts/` — Python scripts for automation, validation, and CLI tools.
- `/docs/` — Documentation, guides, and roadmap.
- `/tests/` — Test scripts and validation code.

---

## 🚀 Project Roadmap
A practical, step-by-step learning path is now available in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

**Topics Covered:**
- Quantum circuit basics & simulation
- Visualizing and running circuits
- Real hardware execution
- Quantum algorithms & applications
- Error mitigation & advanced simulation
- Real-world use cases (chemistry, optimization, ML)
- Best practices & contributing

---

## 📖 Getting Started

1. **Install Python 3.8+**, Git, and Jupyter Notebook
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run a sample circuit:**
   ```bash
   python quantum_circuits.py
   ```
4. **Explore notebooks:**
   Open `first_circuit.ipynb` in Jupyter and try out the code!

## 🛠️ Environment Validation

After installing dependencies, validate your environment:

```bash
python scripts/validate_env.py
```

- This script checks for all required packages and prints their versions.
- Missing packages are clearly reported for troubleshooting.
