# 🌀 Quantum Computing with Qiskit (QCWQ) ⚛️

**A beginner-friendly repository to explore Quantum Computing using Qiskit.**

🚀 This project helps you get started with **writing quantum circuits**, simulating quantum algorithms, and contributing to quantum computing research.

We are about **learning by doing**!

🎭 Whether you're new to Quantum Computing or a seasoned developer, we’ll get hands-on experience writing and experimenting with quantum circuits.

## **📌 Features**

✔️ Simulate quantum circuits  
✔️ Visualize circuits using Matplotlib  
✔️ Run everything in Jupyter Notebook  
✔️ Beginner-friendly learning approach

## 📖 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your **Quantum Computing environment** and start coding!

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have:  
✅ **Python 3.8+**  
✅ **Git installed**  
✅ **Jupyter Notebook installed** (will be installed via `requirements.txt`)

## **📌 Installation**

> **Follow the full setup guide in** [`INSTALATION.md`](/INSTALATION.md).

### 🎭 Let’s Have Fun! Break Things, Experiment, and Learn!

This is not just a tutorial—it's an interactive learning experience!

- ✅ Code along with us!
- ✅ Tweak the circuits, break them, and see what happens!
- ✅ Experiment with different quantum gates and algorithms!

💡 _Pro Tip_: Change the shots value in the simulator to see how the probabilities change. Try adding multiple qubits and see the magic! ✨
