# 🌀 Quantum Computing with Qiskit (QCWQ) ⚛️
**A beginner-friendly repository to explore Quantum Computing using Qiskit.**  

🚀 This project helps you get started with **writing quantum circuits**, simulating quantum algorithms, and contributing to quantum computing research. 

We are about **learning by doing**! 

🎭 Whether you're new to Quantum Computing or a seasoned developer, we’ll get hands-on experience writing and experimenting with quantum circuits.
 
## **📌 Features**
✔️ Simulate quantum circuits  
✔️ Visualize circuits using Matplotlib  
✔️ Run everything in Jupyter Notebook  
✔️ Beginner-friendly learning approach

## 📖 Getting Started  
Follow these steps to set up your **Quantum Computing environment** and start coding!  

## 🔧 Prerequisites  
Before diving in, make sure you have:  
✅ **Python 3.8+**  
✅ **Git installed**  
✅ **Jupyter Notebook installed** (will be installed via `requirements.txt`) 

## **📌 Installation**
> **Follow the full setup guide in** [`INSTALATION.md`](/INSTALATION.md). 

### 🎭 Let’s Have Fun! Break Things, Experiment, and Learn!
This is not just a tutorial—it's an interactive learning experience!
- ✅ Code along with us!
- ✅ Tweak the circuits, break them, and see what happens!
- ✅ Experiment with different quantum gates and algorithms!

💡 *Pro Tip*: Change the shots value in the simulator to see how the probabilities change. Try adding multiple qubits and see the magic! ✨

### 👨‍💻 Contributing: Join the Quantum Fun!
